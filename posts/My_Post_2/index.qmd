In this blog post, we will understand stock price data using the "all_stocks_5yr.csv" dataset. This dataset encompasses historical stock prices for various companies over a 5-year period. Our aim is to explore the insights and patterns in stock prices, making it a valuable experience for those who want to delve into stock market data. The source of the data is from Kaggle and Cam Nugent is the owner the of the dataset.

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/sandp500

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load the S&P 500 stock price dataset
sp500_data <- read_csv("all_stocks_5yr.csv")
head(sp500_data)
```

Now that we have loaded the dataset, let's explore its structure and get a sense of what it contains. Let us explore the summary of this dataset below.

```{r}
str(sp500_data)

# Summary statistics of the dataset
summary(sp500_data)
```

Before we proceed further on to visualizations, I am curious as to what are the names of all these S&P 500 companies or in technical terms what are some company Fund tickers.

```{r}
unique_names <- unique(sp500_data$Name)
print(unique_names)
```

Now, let us look at handling missing data by removing rows with N/A' values in them.

```{r}

missing_data <- sp500_data[is.na(sp500_data$close), c("date", "Name", "close")]

# Remove rows with missing data in the 'close' column
sp500_data <- sp500_data[!is.na(sp500_data$close),]
```

Now since the data is cleared, lets make visualizations to understand stock trends of my favorite company Apple. Apples ticker is AAPL and we hope to analyse it trend for all the years present in the dataset.

```{r}
aapl_data <- sp500_data %>%
  filter(Name == "AAPL")

# Load necessary packages
library(ggplot2)

# Create the plot
ggplot(aapl_data, aes(x = date, y = close, group = 1)) +
  geom_area(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Apple Inc. Stock Prices",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Stock Price") +
  theme_minimal()
```

We can see that While Apple stock is on an upward trajectory overall, their shares plunged from 2015 - 2016 and then recovered eventually. After 2017 there seems a more consistent growth and finally it stablizes.

Similarly, lets look at Microsoft stock trends, which is also another big name in the industry.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Filter the data for Microsoft (MSFT)
msft_data <- sp500_data %>%
  filter(Name == "MSFT")

# Create a line plot for Microsoft stock
msft_plot <- ggplot(msft_data, aes(x = date, y = close)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Microsoft Corp. Stock Prices Over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Stock Price")

# Display the plot
msft_plot
```

Microsoft stock has seen a similar trajectory, It has just been on an upward journey but faced a little plunge around 2015. Both of these graphs show us how tech giants like AAPL and MSFT have grown over years and their stock prices have gone up significantly. These two plots help us understand their stock market presence throughout these past few years.
